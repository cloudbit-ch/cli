## Global Flags
```
  --endpoint-url string     base url to the api endpoints for the platform. the
                            default is the Flow Swiss platform, but this flag
                            can be used to change to any other environment. can
                            also be specified through the `FLOW_ENDPOINT_URL`
                            environment variable or the `endpoint_url` item in
                            your configuration file.

                            example: 'https://api.cloudbit.ch/'


  --username string         the username to authenticate against the Flow Swiss
                            platform. can also be specified through the
                            `FLOW_USERNAME` environment variable or the
                            `username` item in your configuration file.

                            example: 'example@flow.swiss'


  --password string         the password for the specified user on the Flow
                            Swiss platform. can also be specified through the
                            `FLOW_PASSWORD` environment variable or the
                            `password` item in your configuration file.

                            example: 'MySuperSecurePassword'


  --two-factor-code string  the current two factor code for your account. by
                            default it will ask for user input during runtime
                            when you have two factor authentication enabled on
                            your account. 

                            example: '123456'


  --format string           the output format to use for list operations. can be
                            one of table, csv or json. by default all list
                            operations will generate a table with the most
                            important information. if you want to integrate the
                            response into an other system, we suggest using the
                            json option. can also be specified through the
                            `FLOW_FORMAT` environment variable or the `format`
                            item in your configuration file.

                            example: 'json'


  --verbosity level         specifies the verbose output level for the current
                            exectuion. the higher the level, the more output
                            will be generated. this can idealy be used for
                            debugging purposes. the verbose output will be
                            posted to `stderr` to still allow pipes.

                            level 0: default output
                            level 1: show request paths
                            level 2: dump responses from the api
                            level 3: dump requests to the api

                            example: '1'

```
flow compute server list
  Lists all server of the selected organization.
```

```

  --name string (required)  the name for the server. this name will also be used
                            as the hostname of the virtual machine, if you want
                            this to match the name on the portal choose only

  --attach-external-ip bool  whether to attach an elastic ip (public ip) to the
                            virtual machine or not. by default an elastic ip
                            will be attached. to disable use `--attach-external-
                            ip=false`  
```


```
flow compute server [start|stop|reboot] <server>
  Perform an action on the virtual machine. The command will block until the
  server status updates to the expected value.

  <server> string           filter for the server to execute the action on. can
                            be an integer if you want to search by id or a
                            string if you want to search for any other

                            example: 'My First Virtual Machine'
                   
```

```
flow compute server delete <server>
  Detaches all elastic ips attached to the selected server and deletes the
  server product itself.

  <server> string           filter for the server to delete. can be an integer
                            if you want to search by id or a string if you want
                            to serarch for any other identification (e.g. name,
                            public ip, private ip, etc)

                            example: 'My First Virtual Machine'


  --force                   if this flag is present, the interaction with the
                            user whether he really wants to delete the server
                            will be skipped and the server will be deleted
                            immediately


  --detach-only             by default all attached elastic ips will be deleted
                            once they were detached. this can be prevented
                            through this flag and all elastic ips will only be
                            detached.
